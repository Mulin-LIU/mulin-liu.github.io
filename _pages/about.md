I am currently a PhD student at **Nanjing University**, Jiangsu, China, working under the supervision of **Prof. Xi-Yun Hou**. My research focuses on natural bodies in the solar system, especially for asteroids. I am the key developer of the N-body code **astroDEM**, which is under refactoring and the beta version will be released soon. I also made some research on:
- Dynamics of the cislunar space
- Light curve inversion of asteroids

---

Despite my research focus, I have interests in various fields including but not limited to:
- Computer Graphics
- Computational Physics

I use **C++** as my main programming language, and I also have some knowledge of **Python** and **C#**. 
I will share my learning notes and many other things on the Posts page of this website.
