In celestial mechanics, objects are always treated as point masses for simplicity. However, real celestial bodies have finite sizes and can experience tidal forces due to the gravitational influence of other nearby bodies. These tidal forces can lead to deformation, changes in rotation rates, and even orbital evolution. **This article is based on chapter 4 of "Solar System Dynamics" by Murray and Dermott[^book_1]** and summarizes the key concepts related to tides, rotation, and shape.

# The Tidal Bulge

A tidal bulge is a deformation of a celestial body caused by the gravitational pull of another nearby body. Considering the case of the tides raised on a planet of mass $$m_\rm{p}$$ by a satellite of mass $$m_\rm{s}$$, the Newton's law of gravitation gives the mean magnitude of mutual forces $$\langle F \rangle$$ as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\langle F \rangle = \frac{\mathcal{G} m_\rm{p} m_\rm{s}}{r^2}
\end{equation}
\tag{1}
$$

where $$\mathcal{G}$$ is the gravitational constant and $$r$$ is the distance between the centers of the two bodies. Assuming that the bodies move in circular orbits about their common center of mass (see **Figure. 1**), the semi-major axis of the orbits will be related to their masses:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{a_\rm{s}}{a_\rm{p}} = \frac{m_\rm{p}}{m_\rm{s}}
\end{equation}
\tag{2}
$$

where the bodies have a constant separation $$a = a_\rm{p} + a_\rm{s}$$.

</figure>

The center of the planet is denoted as $$P_1$$ and it is in a circular motion about the center of mass $$C_1$$. Neglecting rotations, any other points within the planet (denoted as $$P_2$$) will also be in circular motion, but with a different center $$C_2$$, which is displaced from $$C_1$$ to the same extent as $$P_2$$ is displaced from $$P_1$$ (See **Figure. 2**).

All particles that make up the planet experience equal (both in magnitude and direction) centrifugal forces but different gravitational forces, and we denote the gravitational force as $$\mathbf{F}$$ with the following relation holds:

$$
\begin{equation}
\langle \mathbf{F} \rangle \neq \mathbf{F}.
\end{equation}
\tag{3}
$$

$$\langle \mathbf{F} \rangle$$ is the mean gravitational force in the vector form and the tide generating force $$\mathbf{F}_{\rm{tide}}$$ is then defined by:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}_{\rm{tide}} = \mathbf{F} - \langle \mathbf{F} \rangle.
\end{equation}
\tag{4}
$$

This relation is under the assumption that the planet is rigid and is non-rotating. If the tidal and rotational deformations are small, they can be calculated separately and then superposed to give the total deformation in a linear form.

To determine the shape of the tidal bulge, we consider the potential associated with the tide generating force. The gravitational potential at a point $$P$$ on the surface of the planet is given by:

$$
\begin{equation}
V = -\frac{\mathcal{G} m_\rm{s}}{\Delta},
\end{equation}
\tag{5}
$$

where $$\Delta$$ is the distance between the satellite and point $$P$$ and it can be derived by the geometry shown in **Figure. 3**:

$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta = a[1 - 2(\frac{R_{\rm{p}}}{a})\cos\psi + (\frac{R_{\rm{p}}}{a})^2]^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\end{equation}
\tag{6}
$$

Here, $$R_{\rm{p}}$$ is the radius of the planet and $$\psi$$ is the angle between the line connecting the centers of the two bodies and the line connecting the center of the planet to point $$P$$. In most cases, $$R_{\rm{p}} \ll a$$, allowing us to expand the potential in powers of $$(\frac{R_{\rm{p}}}{a})$$. Retaining terms up to the second order, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
V &\approx -\frac{\mathcal{G} m_\rm{s}}{a}[1 + (\frac{R_{\rm{p}}}{a})\cos\psi + \frac{1}{2}(\frac{R_{\rm{p}}}{a})^2(3\cos^2\psi - 1)] \\
  &= V_1 + V_2 + V_3
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\tag{7}
$$

In **Eq. (7)**, the three terms represent different components of the potential:
- $$V_1$$ is a constant term that does not contribute to the tide generating force.
- $$V_2$$ corresponds to the force required to keep the particle at point $$P$$ in circular motion. This can be shown by calculating the gradient of $$V_2$$:

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  -\frac{\partial V_2}{\partial (R_{\rm{p}}\cos\psi)} = \frac{\mathcal{G} m_\rm{s}}{a^2} = \frac{\langle F \rangle}{m_\rm{p}}
  \end{equation}
  \tag{8}
  $$

- $$V_3$$ is associated with the potential at the surface of the planet and it can be rewritten as:

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  V_{3}(\psi) = -\mathcal{G} \frac{m_{\rm{s}}}{a^3} R_{\rm{p}}^{2} \mathcal{P}_{2}(\cos \psi),
  \end{equation}
  \tag{9}
  $$

  where $$\mathcal{P}_{2}(\cos \psi) = \frac{1}{2}(3\cos^2\psi - 1)$$ is the Legendre polynomial of degree 2 in $$\cos \psi$$. This term represents the tide raising potential because:

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  \frac{\mathbf{F}_{\rm{tide}}}{m_\rm{p}} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{m_\rm{p}} - \frac{\langle \mathbf{F} \rangle}{m_\rm{p}} = -\nabla V - \frac{\langle \mathbf{F} \rangle}{m_\rm{p}}   \approx -\nabla V_3(\psi).
  \end{equation}
  \tag{10}
  $$

  To simplify the notation, we can write the tide raising potential $$V_3 (\psi)$$ as:

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  V_3 (\psi) = -\zeta g \mathcal{P}_2(\cos \psi),
  \end{equation}
  \tag{11}
  $$

  where $$\zeta = \frac{m_{\rm{s}}}{m_{\rm{p}}} (\frac{R_{\rm{p}}}{a})^3 R_{\rm{p}}$$ and $$g = \frac{\mathcal{G} m_{\rm{p}}}{R_{\rm{p}}^2}$$ is the surface gravity of the planet. $$\zeta \mathcal{P}_2(\cos \psi)$$ represents the amplitude of the equilibrium tide on the planet for any given angle $$\psi$$. As the term $$\mathcal{P}_2(\cos \psi)$$ has a period of $$\pi$$, the Moon produces two high tides and two low tides on the Earth each day.
