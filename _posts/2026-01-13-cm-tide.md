This article is a study note of the effects of tidal forces on the rotation and shape of celestial bodies.

In celestial mechanics, objects are always treated as point masses for simplicity. However, real celestial bodies have finite sizes and can experience tidal forces due to the gravitational influence of other nearby bodies. These tidal forces can lead to deformation, changes in rotation rates, and even orbital evolution. This article is based on chapter 4 of "Solar System Dynamics" by Murray and Dermott[^book_1] and summarizes the key concepts related to tides, rotation, and shape.

# The Tidal Bulge

A tidal bulge is a deformation of a celestial body caused by the gravitational pull of another nearby body. Considering the case of the tides raised on a planet of mass $$m_\rm{p}$$ by a satellite of mass $$m_\rm{s}$$, the Newton's law of gravitation gives the mean magnitude of mutual forces $$\langle F \rangle$$ as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\langle F \rangle = \frac{\mathcal{G} m_\rm{p} m_\rm{s}}{r^2}
\end{equation}
\tag{1}
$$

where $$\mathcal{G}$$ is the gravitational constant and $$r$$ is the distance between the centers of the two bodies. Assuming that the bodies move in circular orbits about their common center of mass (see Fig. 1), the semi-major axis of the orbits will be related to their masses:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{a_\rm{s}}{a_\rm{p}} = \frac{m_\rm{p}}{m_\rm{s}}
\end{equation}
\tag{2}
$$

where the bodies have a constant separation $$a = a_\rm{p} + a_\rm{s}$$.

The center of the planet is denoted as $$P_1$$ and it is in a circular motion about the center of mass $$C_1$$. Neglecting rotations, any other points within the planet (denoted as $$P_2$$) will also be in circular motion, but with a different center $$C_2$$, which is displaced from $$C_1$$ to the same extent as $$P_2$$ is displaced from $$P_1$$ (See Fig. 2).
