In celestial mechanics, objects are always treated as point masses for simplicity. However, real celestial bodies have finite sizes and can experience tidal forces due to the gravitational influence of other nearby bodies. These tidal forces can lead to deformation, changes in rotation rates, and even orbital evolution. **This article is based on chapter 4 of "Solar System Dynamics" by Murray and Dermott[^book_1]** and summarizes the key concepts related to tides, rotation, and shape.

# The Tidal Bulge

A tidal bulge is a deformation of a celestial body caused by the gravitational pull of another nearby body. Considering the case of the tides raised on a planet of mass $$m_\rm{p}$$ by a satellite of mass $$m_\rm{s}$$, the Newton's law of gravitation gives the mean magnitude of mutual forces $$\langle F \rangle$$ as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\langle F \rangle = \frac{\mathcal{G} m_\rm{p} m_\rm{s}}{r^2}
\end{equation}
\tag{1}
$$

where $$\mathcal{G}$$ is the gravitational constant and $$r$$ is the distance between the centers of the two bodies. Assuming that the bodies move in circular orbits about their common center of mass (see **Figure. 1**), the semi-major axis of the orbits will be related to their masses:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{a_\rm{s}}{a_\rm{p}} = \frac{m_\rm{p}}{m_\rm{s}}
\end{equation}
\tag{2}
$$

where the bodies have a constant separation $$a = a_\rm{p} + a_\rm{s}$$.

    A planet and satellite moving about their common centre of mass in circular orbits. 
    </figcaption>
</figure>

The center of the planet is denoted as $$P_1$$ and it is in a circular motion about the center of mass $$C_1$$. Neglecting rotations, any other points within the planet (denoted as $$P_2$$) will also be in circular motion, but with a different center $$C_2$$, which is displaced from $$C_1$$ to the same extent as $$P_2$$ is displaced from $$P_1$$ (See **Figure. 2**).

      <figcaption> <b>Figure. 2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      All the particles in the planet move in similar circles of identical radii, but with different centres. 
      </figcaption>
</figure>

All particles that make up the planet experience equal (both in magnitude and direction) centrifugal forces but different gravitational forces, and we denote the gravitational force as $$\mathbf{F}$$ with the following relation holds:

$$
\begin{equation}
\langle \mathbf{F} \rangle \neq \mathbf{F}.
\end{equation}
\tag{3}
$$

$$\langle \mathbf{F} \rangle$$ is the mean gravitational force in the vector form and the tide generating force $$\mathbf{F}_{\rm{tide}}$$ is then defined by:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}_{\rm{tide}} = \mathbf{F} - \langle \mathbf{F} \rangle.
\end{equation}
\tag{4}
$$

This relation is under the assumption that the planet is rigid and is non-rotating. If the tidal and rotational deformations are small, they can be calculated separately and then superposed to give the total deformation in a linear form.

To determine the shape of the tidal bulge, we consider the potential associated with the tide generating force. The gravitational potential at a point $$P$$ on the surface of the planet is given by:

$$
\begin{equation}
V = -\frac{\mathcal{G} m_\rm{s}}{\Delta},
\end{equation}
\tag{5}
$$

where $$\Delta$$ is the distance between the satellite and point $$P$$ and it can be derived by the geometry shown in **Figure. 3**:

$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta = a[1 - 2(\frac{R_{\rm{p}}}{a})\cos\psi + (\frac{R_{\rm{p}}}{a})^2]^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\end{equation}
\tag{6}
$$

    <img src="/images/2026-01-13-cm-tide-figures/figure3.png" alt="The relationships among the radius of the planet, the semi-major axis of the satellite, and the distance from a point on the surface of the planet. " >

</figure>

Here, $$R_{\rm{p}}$$ is the radius of the planet and $$\psi$$ is the angle between the line connecting the centers of the two bodies and the line connecting the center of the planet to point $$P$$. In most cases, $$R_{\rm{p}} \ll a$$, allowing us to expand the potential in powers of $$(\frac{R_{\rm{p}}}{a})$$. Retaining terms up to the second order, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
V &\approx -\frac{\mathcal{G} m_\rm{s}}{a}[1 + (\frac{R_{\rm{p}}}{a})\cos\psi + \frac{1}{2}(\frac{R_{\rm{p}}}{a})^2(3\cos^2\psi - 1)] \\
  &= V_1 + V_2 + V_3
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\tag{7}
$$

> 

In **Eq. (7)**, the three terms represent different components of the potential:
- $$V_1$$ is a constant term that does not contribute to the tide generating force.
- $$V_2$$ corresponds to the force required to keep the particle at point $$P$$ in circular motion. This can be shown by calculating the gradient of $$V_2$$:

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  -\frac{\partial V_2}{\partial (R_{\rm{p}}\cos\psi)} = \frac{\mathcal{G} m_\rm{s}}{a^2} = \frac{\langle F \rangle}{m_\rm{p}}
  \end{equation}
  \tag{8}
  $$

- $$V_3$$ is associated with the potential at the surface of the planet and it can be rewritten as:

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  V_{3}(\psi) = -\mathcal{G} \frac{m_{\rm{s}}}{a^3} R_{\rm{p}}^{2} \mathcal{P}_{2}(\cos \psi),
  \end{equation}
  \tag{9}
  $$

  where $$\mathcal{P}_{2}(\cos \psi) = \frac{1}{2}(3\cos^2\psi - 1)$$ is the Legendre polynomial of degree 2 in $$\cos \psi$$. This term represents the tide raising potential because:

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  \frac{\mathbf{F}_{\rm{tide}}}{m_\rm{p}} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{m_\rm{p}} - \frac{\langle \mathbf{F} \rangle}{m_\rm{p}} = -\nabla V - \frac{\langle \mathbf{F} \rangle}{m_\rm{p}}   \approx -\nabla V_3(\psi).
  \end{equation}
  \tag{10}
  $$

  To simplify the notation, we can write the tide raising potential $$V_3 (\psi)$$ as:

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  V_3 (\psi) = -\zeta g \mathcal{P}_2(\cos \psi),
  \end{equation}
  \tag{11}
  $$

  where $$\zeta = \frac{m_{\rm{s}}}{m_{\rm{p}}} (\frac{R_{\rm{p}}}{a})^3 R_{\rm{p}}$$ and $$g = \frac{\mathcal{G} m_{\rm{p}}}{R_{\rm{p}}^2}$$ is the surface gravity of the planet. $$\zeta \mathcal{P}_2(\cos \psi)$$ represents the amplitude of the equilibrium tide on the planet for any given angle $$\psi$$. As the term $$\mathcal{P}_2(\cos \psi)$$ has a period of $$\pi$$, the Moon produces two high tides and two low tides on the Earth each day.

The tidal deformation of the Earth is complicated because of the following reasons:
- The Sun and the Moon both contribute significantly to the tides.
- The Sun and the Moon both orbit around the earth in paths that are eccentric and inclined to the equator of the Earth.

    <img src="/images/2026-01-13-cm-tide-figures/figure4.png" alt="Schematic diagram of the shape of the tidal distortion (solid line) arising from the tidal term in the gravitational potential compared with the circular, zero-distortion shape (dashed line). " >

      </figcaption>
</figure>

As is shown in **Figure. 4(a)**, the axis of symmetry of the tidal distortion passes through the centers of the two bodies, the Earth rotates about the $$z$$-axis with angular speed of $$\Omega$$, and we assume that the Moon has a mean motion $$n$$ and inclination $$I$$ with respect to the equatorial plane of the Earth. Colatitudes and longitudes of the Moon $$(\theta_\rm{M}, \phi_\rm{M})$$ and a point $$P$$ $$(\theta_\rm{P}, \phi_\rm{P})$$ on the surface of the Earth are defined in **Figure. 4(b)**. Note that the angle $$\theta$$ and $$\phi$$ are both measured in space and not from the rotating frame of the Earth. 

The former defined angle $$\psi$$ can be expressed in:

$$
\begin{equation}
\cos \psi =  \cos \theta_\rm{P} \cos \theta_\rm{M} + \sin \theta_\rm{P} \sin \theta_\rm{M} \cos (\phi_\rm{P} - \phi_\rm{M}),
\end{equation}
\tag{12}
$$

and hence the term $$\mathcal{P}_2(\cos \psi)$$ in **Eq. (11)** can be re-written as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{P}_2(\cos \psi) &= \frac{1}{2}(3\cos^2\psi - 1) \\
                         &= \frac{1}{2}(3\cos^2 \theta_\rm{P} - 1)\frac{1}{2}(3\cos^2 \theta_\rm{M} - 1) \\
                          & \ \ + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 \theta_\rm{P} \sin^2 \theta_\rm{M} \cos 2(\phi_\rm{P} - \phi_\rm{M}) \\
                          & \ \ + \frac{3}{4} \sin 2\theta_\rm{P} \sin 2\theta_\rm{M} \cos (\phi_\rm{P} - \phi_\rm{M})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\tag{13}
$$

The colatitude $$\theta_\rm{P}$$ of a fixed point on the surface of the Earth is constant, and the tidal amplitude at that point $$P$$ varies with $$\phi_\rm{P}$$, $$\phi_\rm{M}$$, and $$\theta_\rm{M}$$:
- The first term in **Eq. (13)** is determined by $$\cos^2 \theta_\rm{M}$$, which varies with frequency $$2n$$ and gives rise to a fortnightly tide.
- The second term varies with frequency $$2(\Omega - n)$$ and gives rise to the semi-diurnal tide.
- The third term varies with frequency $$(\Omega - n) $$ and gives rise to the diurnal tide.

> **Note**
> 
> Both the second term and the third term are modulated by $$\theta_\rm{M}$$ factors. The third term contains a $$\sin 2\theta_\rm{M}$$ factor, and it provides a strong fortnightly modulation of the diurnal tide. 
>

Similar results can be drawn for the tides raised by the Sun on the Earth. The ration of the solar tide to the lunar tide is given by:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\zeta_\rm{S}}{\zeta_\rm{M}} = \frac{m_\rm{S}}{m_\rm{M}} (\frac{a_\rm{M}}{a_\rm{S}})^3 \approx 0.46.
\end{equation}
$$

For the tide raised by the Moon on the Earth, $$\zeta = 0.36 \ \rm{m}$$, while for the solar tide, $$\zeta = 0.16 \ \rm{m}$$.

# The Potential Theory

Some results are summarized derived from potential theory before discussing the tidal and rotational deformations of a celestial body.

The gravitational potential of a homogeneous, spherical body of density $$\gamma$$ and radius $$C$$ can be calculated by considering the internal and external potentials of a thin spherical shell of radius $$r$$, thickness $$\delta r$$, and mass $$\delta m$$. The potential exterior to the shell at point with $$r^\prime$$ from its center is given by:

$$
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm{ext}}(r^\prime) = -\frac{\mathcal{G} \delta m}{r^\prime},
\end{equation}
\tag{14}
$$

and is the same as if all mass were concentrated at the center of the shell. Thus the external potential at the surface of the uniform sphere is:

$$ 
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm{ext}}(C) = -\frac{\mathcal{G} \sum \delta m}{C} = -\frac{4}{3}\pi \gamma \mathcal{G} C^2.
\end{equation}
\tag{15}
$$

The force on a particle interior to the shell is zero, and hence the internal potential at point interior to the shell is constant and can be determined by calculating the potential at any point in the interior. Calculating the potential at the center of the shell, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm{int}}(r) = -\frac{\mathcal{G} \delta m}{r} = -4\pi \gamma \mathcal{G} r \delta r.
\end{equation}
\tag{16}
$$

> **Note**
>
> There is an error in the book "Solar System Dynamics" in **Eq. (4.20)**, where there should not be a sum sign in the equation.
> The equation corresponds to **Eq. (16)** here.
>

The internal potential of a uniform shell of external radius $$C$$ and internal radius $$B$$ can then be given by:

$$
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm{int}}(C, B) = -4\pi \gamma \mathcal{G} \int_{B}^{C} r \rm{d}r = -2\pi \gamma \mathcal{G} (C^2 - B^2).
\end{equation}
\tag{17}
$$

For now, we can write the external and internal potentials of a uniform spherical body of radius $$C$$ as:

$$
\begin{equation}
V(r) = \begin{cases}
-\frac{4}{3}\pi \gamma \mathcal{G} (3C^2 - r^2), & r < C \\
-\frac{4}{3}\pi \gamma \mathcal{G} \frac{C^3}{r}, & r \geq C
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\tag{18}
$$

Some concepts are included here:
- The **Laplace's equation** writes: 

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  \nabla^2 V = 0,
  \end{equation}
  \tag{19}
  $$

  and it holds for gravitational potentials in free space (i.e., in the absence of mass).
- A function $$V$$ is said to be **homogeneous of degree $$n$$** if it satisfies the **Euler's equation**:

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  \mathbf{r} \cdot \nabla V = nV.
  \end{equation}
  \tag{20}
  $$

  > **Note**
  >
  > In cartesian coordinates, **Eq. (20)** can be written as:
  >
  > $$
  > \begin{equation}
  > x \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} + y \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} + z \frac{\partial V}{\partial z} = nV.
  > \end{equation}
  > $$
  >

- **Homogeneous function** that also satisfies **Laplace's equation** are called **spherical solid harmonics**. When transformed into spherical polar coordinates, they can be factored into three functions of $$r$$, $$\theta$$, and $$\phi$$.

The Laplace's equation in spherical polar coordinates is given by:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 \frac{\partial V}{\partial r}) + \frac{1}{\sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} (\sin \theta \frac{\partial V}{\partial \theta}) + \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \phi^2} = 0.
\end{equation}
\tag{21}
$$

Using $$\mu = \cos \theta$$ the equation can be rewritten as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 \frac{\partial V}{\partial r}) + \frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} ((1 - \mu^2) \frac{\partial V}{\partial \mu}) + \frac{1}{1 - \mu^2} \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \phi^2} = 0.
\end{equation}
\tag{22}
$$

The Laplace's equation can be solved by the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form:

$$
\begin{equation}
V(r, \mu, \phi) = r^n S_n (\mu, \phi),
\end{equation}
\tag{23}
$$

and substituting it into **Eq. (22)** gives:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} ((1 - \mu^2) \frac{\partial S_n}{\partial \mu}) + \frac{1}{1 - \mu^2} \frac{\partial^2 S_n}{\partial \phi^2} + n(n + 1) S_n = 0.
\end{equation}
\tag{24}
$$

This is **Legendre's equation** and any function $$S_n(\mu, \phi)$$ that satisfies it is called a **spherical harmonic of degree $$n$$**. When writing $$-(n+1)$$ to $$n$$, the equation remains unchanged, and thus the general solution of the Laplace's equation can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{equation}
V(r, \mu, \phi) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} [A_n r^n + B_n r^{-(n+1)}] S_n (\mu, \phi),
\end{equation}
\tag{25}
$$

where $$A_n$$ and $$B_n$$ are constants determined by boundary conditions. Each of the terms in this expansion is called a **solid harmonic** of degree $$n$$ and $$-(n+1)$$ respectively.

Because of the axial symmetry of the tidal potential, only the zonal harmonics (i.e., those independent of $$\phi$$) are needed. The equation is then reduced to:

$$
\begin{equation}

(1-\mu^2) \frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{P}_n(\mu)}{\partial \mu^2} - 2\mu \frac{\partial \mathcal{P}_n(\mu)}{\partial \mu} + n(n+1) \mathcal{P}_n(\mu) = 0,
\end{equation}
\tag{26}
$$

where $$\mathcal{P}_n(\mu)$$ is the Legendre polynomial of degree $$n$$. The first few Legendre polynomials are:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{P}_0(\mu) &= 1, \\
\mathcal{P}_1(\mu) &= \mu = \cos \theta, \\
\mathcal{P}_2(\mu) &= \frac{1}{2}(3\mu^2 - 1) = \frac{1}{4}(3\cos 2\theta + 1).\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\tag{27}
$$

The surface harmonics have the following properties:
- They are orthogonal over the surface of a sphere, i.e. 

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{-1}^{1} Y_m(\mu, \phi) S_n(\mu, \phi) \rm{d}\mu \rm{d}\phi = 0, \ \ m \neq n,
  \end{equation}
  \tag{28}
  $$

  where $$Y_n(\mu, \phi)$$ and $$S_n(\mu, \phi)$$ are surface harmonics of degree $$n$$ and $$m$$ respectively.

- If two surface harmonics of the same degree $$n$$ and one is a zonal harmonic $$\mathcal{P}_n(\mu)$$, then

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{-1}^{1} \mathcal{P}_n(\mu) S_n(\mu, \phi) \rm{d}\mu \rm{d}\phi = \frac{4\pi}{2n + 1} S_n(1),
  \end{equation}
  \tag{29}
  $$

  where $$S_n(1)$$ is the value of the surface harmonic at the pole of $$\mathcal{P}_n(\mu)$$.
Consider two points on a unit sphere with variable $$(\theta^\prime, \phi^\prime)$$ and fixed $$(\theta, \phi)$$. Let $$\psi$$ be the angle between the two vectors from the center of the sphere to these two points, and consider the integral:

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{-1}^{1} S_n(\mu^\prime, \phi^\prime) \mathcal{P}_n(\cos \psi) \rm{d}\mu^\prime \rm{d}\phi^\prime.
  \end{equation}
  \tag{30}
  $$

  This integral can be evaluated by changing to the coordinates with the new axis defining the variable colatitude $$\theta^\prime$$ passing through the fixed point $$(\theta, \phi) $$ and the new variable point is denoted as $$(\Theta^\prime, \Phi^\prime)$$. In the new coordinates, $$\psi = \Theta^\prime$$ and hence the integral becomes (denote $$Y_n  (\Theta^\prime, \Phi^\prime)$$ as the surface harmonic in the new coordinates):

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{-1}^{1} Y_n (\Theta^\prime, \Phi^\prime) \mathcal{P}_n(\cos \Theta^\prime) \rm{d}\cos \Theta^\prime \rm{d}\Phi^\prime = \frac{4\pi}{2n + 1} Y_n(1).
  \end{equation}
  \tag{31}
  $$

  Because the chosen coordinates uses the fixed point $$(\theta, \phi)$$ as the pole, we have $$Y_n(1) = S_n(\theta, \phi)$$. It follows that the integral in **Eq. (30)** evaluates  to:

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{-1}^{1} S_n(\mu^\prime, \phi^\prime) \mathcal{P}_n(\cos \psi) \rm{d}\mu^\prime \rm{d}\phi^\prime = \frac{4\pi}{2n + 1} S_n(\mu, \phi).
  \end{equation}
  \tag{32}
  $$

  That is to say, the integral of the product of a surface harmonic and a zonal harmonic of the same degree over the surface of a sphere gives a result proportional to the value of the surface harmonic at the point defining the axis of the zonal harmonic.

Consider a nearly spherical body of mean radius $$C$$ with:

$$
\begin{equation}
R(\theta^\prime) = C(1 + \epsilon_2 \mathcal{P}_2(\cos \theta^\prime)),
\end{equation}
\tag{33}
$$

where $$\epsilon_2 \ll 1$$ is a constant. Choosing the colatitude $$\theta$$ measured from the axis of symmetry of the tidal bulge, the gravitational potential at point $$P$$ with spherical coordinates $$(r, \theta, \phi)$$ can be separated into two parts. The first part is the potential due to a perfect sphere of radius $$C$$, which corresponds to **Eq. (18)**, while the second part is the potential due to the deformation of the body, as shown in **Figure. 5**.

</figure>

> **Note**
>
> In **Eq. (33)**, $$P_2(\cos \theta^\prime) = \frac{1}{2} (3 \cos^2 \theta^\prime - 1) = \frac{1}{4}(3\cos 2\theta^\prime + 1)$$, which means that the body is elongated along the axis $$\theta^\prime = 0$$ and $$\theta^\prime = \pi$$, and is compressed in the equatorial plane $$\theta^\prime = \frac{\pi}{2}$$ and $$\theta^\prime = \frac{3\pi}{2}$$.
>

Denoting a point $$P^\prime$$ on the surface of the deformed body with spherical coordinates $$(r^\prime, \mu^\prime, \phi^\prime)$$, we have:
- the deviation between the surface of the deformed body and the spherical body is given by $$\epsilon_2 C \mathcal{P}_2 (\mu^\prime)$$,
- the volume element at the point $$P^\prime$$ is $$\epsilon_2 C^3 \mathcal{P}_2(\mu^\prime) \rm{d} \mu^\prime \rm{d} \phi^\prime$$.

The potential at point $$P$$ due to the deformation of the body is then directly related to the distance between points $$P$$ and $$P^\prime$$, and it can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{PP^\prime} &= \frac{1}{\Delta} = (C^2 + r^2 - 2Cr \cos \psi)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \\
                    &= 
                    \begin{cases}
                    \frac{1}{C} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (\frac{r}{C})^n \mathcal{P}_n(\cos \psi), & r < C \\
                    \frac{1}{r} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (\frac{C}{r})^{n} \mathcal{P}_n(\cos \psi), & r > C
                    \end{cases}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\tag{34}
$$

The noncentral potential at point $$P$$ due to the deformation of the body can then be calculated by integrating over the surface of the deformed body:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
V = V_{\rm{c}} + V_{\rm{nc}} &= V_{\rm{c}} + \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{-1}^{1} -\mathcal{G} \gamma \epsilon_2 C^3 \mathcal{P}_2(\mu^\prime) \frac{1}{PP^\prime} \rm{d}\mu^\prime \rm{d}\phi^\prime \\

The expression of the central part $$V_{\rm{c}}$$ is given in **Eq. (18)**, and the noncentral potential $$V_{\rm{nc}}$$ arises from the deformation of the body.

# Tidal Deformation

The total potential at a point $$P$$ on the surface of a planet is expressed as:

$$
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm{total}}(r, \psi) = -\frac{\mathcal{G} m_\rm{p}}{B} + gh(\psi) - \zeta g \mathcal{P}_2(\cos \psi).
\end{equation}
\tag{36}
$$

The symbls are defined as follows:
- $$B$$ is the mean radius of the planet;
- $$h(\psi)$$ is the local height of the equipotential surface;
- $$- \zeta g \mathcal{P}_2(\cos \psi)$$ is the tide raising potential defined in **Eq. (11)**.

On an equipotential surface this expression should be independent of $$\psi$$, and hence the local height of the equipotential should be $$h(\psi) = \zeta \mathcal{P}_2(\cos \psi)$$. The equilibrium tide then defines the shape of a shalow, zero-density ocean covering an inflexible, spherical planet. However, no fluid has zero density and no solid is inflexble. The actual tidal deformation of a planet depends on many factors.

> **Note**
>
> For static equilibrium of a fluid body, the total potential on its surface must be constant. That is to say, the surface of the body is an equipotential surface. If not, fluid will flow from high potential regions to low potential regions until equilibrium is reached. That is the reason why the local height of the equipotential surface $$h(\psi)$$ is defined as above.

Consider the case of a simple, two-component model planet that has a mean radius of $$B$$, a homogeneous, imcompressible fluid ocean of density $$\sigma$$, and a homogeneous, incompressible solid core of radius $$A$$, density $$\rho$$ and rigidity $$\mu$$.

> **Note**
>
> The regidity $$\mu$$ is defined as the force needed to produce a unit shear strain in a material. It has the same dimension as pressure.
> In this model, it is used as a measure of the force needed to deform the elastic body.
